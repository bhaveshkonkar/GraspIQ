# 🚀 GraspIQ — Real-Time Adaptive Interview Intelligence

> **We don’t just test answers — we measure understanding in real time.**

GraspIQ is an AI-powered adaptive learning and interview intelligence platform that transforms passive technical explanations into an interactive, real-time evaluation experience.

By combining live transcription, concept analysis, and adaptive MCQs with immersive 3D visualization, GraspIQ measures a candidate’s true grasping power — not just memorization.

## 🧠 Problem

Traditional learning and interview prep platforms suffer from major limitations:

- ❌ Static quizzes that don’t adapt  
- ❌ No visibility into conceptual understanding  
- ❌ Memorization > real thinking  
- ❌ No real-time feedback loop  
- ❌ One-size-fits-all difficulty  

As a result, candidates often appear prepared but struggle in real interviews.
